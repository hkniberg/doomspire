<harvest-phase-decision-request>
You have finished using all your dice for this turn. Now you are in the harvest phase where you can:

1. Use existing buildings (if you have any and can afford them)
2. Perform one build action (construct a building, recruit a champion, etc.)

## Building Usage:

{{availableBuildings}}

## Build Actions:

{{availableBuildActions}}

Consider your current strategic situation and resource needs. Build actions happen after building usage, so you can use buildings to gain resources/might and then spend those resources on build actions.

You may use multiple buildings if you have them and can afford them, but you can only perform one build action per turn.
