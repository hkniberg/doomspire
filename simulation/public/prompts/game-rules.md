## Components

### Dice

- 2 D3 dice per player (six-sided dice showing 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3)

### Player Components (per player)

- 1 Castle board (individual player board with 4 building slots on one side and 8 on the other)
- 1 Plastic castle model, place in the center of your castle board.
- 3 Knight figures per player.
- 10 Flag tokens per player.
- 2 boat figures per player, and 1 warship upgrade available per player.
- 3 Knight inventory cards per player, to track items carried by each knight.
- 1 cheat sheet per player, to track the rules.

### Starting Player Token

- 1 Starting Player token to track turn order

### Resource tokens

- Food tokens
- Wood tokens
- Ore tokens
- Gold tokens

### Cards

- Adventure cards (organized by tier and biome)
- Trader item cards (deck placed next to board for browsing)

### Marker tokens

- Monster marker tokens (with image and name, placed in tiles to mark monster presence)
- Item marker tokens (with image and name, placed in tiles to mark item presence)

### Main Board

- 8x8 grid representing the exploration island
- 4 L-shaped Water zones surrounding the island (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast).
- Fame track, and a fame marker per player.
- Might track, and a might marker per player.

### Land tiles

The board is organized into 3 tiers. The outer two layers are Tier 1, the inner middle layer is Tier 2, and the center 4 tiles are Tier 3. High tier means higher risk but higher reward. The dragon lives in one of the Tier 3 tiles.

- **Home tiles** (4 tiles): These are corner tiles that representing the home of the player, the landing spot where the player's knights start. They are non-combat zones, and are automatically claimed by the player from the start of the game. This claim is permanent and cannot be removed.
- **Special locations**:
  - **Temple tile**: Sacrifice 3 Fame to gain 1 Might. This is a non-combat zone.
  - **Trader tile**: Purchase any resource for 2 gold per resource. This is a non-combat zone.
  - **Mercenary Camp tile**: Buy 1 might for 3 gold. This is a non-combat zone.
  - **Doomspire tile**: The ancient mountain where the great dragon rules. Defeat, impress, or bribe the dragon to win the game. This tile is one of the four hidden tiles in the middle of the board.
  - **Wolf Den tile**: These tiles start with a wolf monster already placed on them.
  - **Bear Cave tile**: Located in Tier 2 areas. When a bear cave tile is revealed through exploration, immediately place a bear monster on it.
- **Resource tiles**: A resource tile provides specific types of resources such as food, wood, ore, or gold. A player must claim it first, and can then start harvesting resources in the same turn during the harvest phase. Starred resource tiles are strategically important, a player who owns all starred resource tiles wins the game if they visit the dragon and bribe it.
- **Adventure tiles**: These tiles contain adventure cards such as monsters, events, and treasures. Any knight landing on an adventure tile must draw a card (if there are any cards left). When all adventure cards are done they tile is considered to be barren.
- **Oasis tiles**: Similar to adventure tiles, these start with 2 adventure tokens. The key difference is that while regular adventure tiles never get restocked once depleted, oasis tiles can be restocked through certain event cards.

### Ocean tiles

- Each ocean tile covers one corner of the board, touching 7 coastal tiles in total. For example the northwest ocean tile touches the home tile in the corner, and the 3 tiles to the east of the home tile and 3 tiles to the south of the home tile.

### Adventure cards

Adventure cards represent things the player can encounter on a tile. Each adventure tile has a marker for how many adventures remain there. When landing on an adventure tile, the player reduces the counter and draws a card. The player can choose from 3 different piles of cards within that tier.

Each card has a biome printed on the back, giving a hint as to what type of encounters it may contain.

- Plains: More likely to provide food
- Woodlands: More likely to provide wood
- Mountains: More likely to provide ore

Cards are organized by tier - so each of the three tiers has its own set of cards. Each tier is in turn randomly split into 3 decks.

> Example: A player lands on a Tier 2 adventure tile. Is has 2 adventure counters left on it, so the player can carry out an adventure. He looks at the three piles of Tier 2 adventure cards, and sees the top card of pile 1 is a Plains card, the top card on pile 2 is also a Plains card, while the top card on pile 3 is a Mountain card. The player is hoping to find some ore, so he draws from pile 3.

If an adventure tile counter is reduced to 0 on a tile, then no more adventures are found there, so the tile is considered to be barren. Note that oasis tiles can be restocked through certain event cards, unlike regular adventure tiles.

When turning a card, there are three types:

- **Monsters cards**: Fight the monster, and if victorious, gain fame and resources. The card has three numbers:
  - Might: The monster's might. This is the number you need to match or exceeed, using a D3 roll + your might + 1 might for any supporting knights from neighbouring tiles.
  - Fame: The amount of fame you gain if you defeat the monster.
  - Resources: The amount of resources you gain if you defeat the monster.
- **Events cards**: Each event card is unique, so read and follow the instructions.
- **Treasures cards**: Gain the treasure, add it to the inventory of your knight. The knight can only carry 2 items at a time, so if you find a third item, you must drop one item in the tile, which can be picked up by another knight who lands there.

## How to Play

### Turn Structure

The game follows a structured turn sequence with the Starting Player token rotating after each complete round:

1. **Roll Dice Phase** (Parallel): All players simultaneously roll their dice
   - Number of dice = 1 (for your castle) + 1 per knight
   - **Dice Tax**: For every die after the first two, you must pay 2 food
   - If you cannot pay the food cost, you cannot roll those extra dice
2. **Move Phase** (Sequential): Starting with the Starting Player and continuing clockwise, each player uses their pre-rolled dice to perform movement and board actions
   - Only actions involving knights or boats are performed here
   - Players may save dice for the harvest phase
3. **Harvest Phase** (Parallel): All players simultaneously use remaining dice for harvest and build actions
   - Use remaining dice for harvest or build actions
   - Includes non-dice actions (like using your blacksmith if you have one)
4. **End Turn**: Pass the Starting Player token to the next player clockwise

### Available Actions

Each action die can be used for ONE of the following:

**Move Phase Actions:**

- **Move & Act**: Move a knight and perform tile action
- **Boat Travel**: Move boat and transport a knight

**Harvest Phase Actions:**

- **Harvest**: Collect resources from claimed tiles
- **Build**: Construct a building in your castle, or recruit a new knight

---

## Actions

### Action: Move & Act

**Movement Rules:**

- Spend an action die to move horizontally or vertically (no diagonal movement), up to the number of steps indicated by the die. You can also move 0 steps if you want to stay in the same tile and interact with it (for example to draw another adventure card).
- You cannot have multiple knights in the same tile (except when respawning in the home tile).
- A knight must stop when entering an unexplored tile - you cannot pass through unexplored tiles.
- If you end your movement in a tile with another knight, battle will ensue, unless it is a non-combat zone (such as the temple, trader, mercenary camp).
- A knight cannot enter another player's home tile.
- You can pass through other knights, but when passing another player's knight, they may choose to initiate combat, in which case your knight is forced to stop and fight and cannot pass through.
- A knight can use multiple dice to move further in a single action, treating that as if it was a single dice roll.
- Once a knight performs any tile action, they cannot move or do anything else that turn.
- The restrictions above also apply when a knight is transported by boat.

**Tile Actions:**

- **Unexplored Tile**: Reveal tile, gain 1 Fame, resolve explore cards if any
- **Resource Tile**: Claim with flag (if unclaimed) OR challenge existing claim
- **Special Location**: Use location ability
- **Monster Tile**: Fight the monster

### Action: Harvest Resources

- Spend an action die to collect resources from tiles you own (tiles with your flag on it).
- Die value = number of different resource tiles you can harvest from
- When you harvest from a tile, you receive ALL the resources that tile produces.
- If an opposing knight is on one of your tiles, you cannot harvest from it.
- If you are blockading another player's tile, that tile is available for you to harvest from.
- Your starting home tile is a special resource tile that provides 1 wood and 1 food when harvested. It can't be blockaded or conquered by another knight. It is permanently claimed by you from the start of the game.
- Tiles claimed during the move phase are available for harvesting in the same turn's harvest phase.

**Examples**:

- Player 1 owns a 1x food tile and a 2x gold tile. They roll a 2 and use that die to harvest. They can choose to harvest from both tiles, gaining 1 food and 2 gold.
- Player 1 owns a 1x wood tile, a 1x ore tile, and a 3x gold tile. They roll a 2 and use that die to harvest. They can choose any 2 of their tiles to harvest from - for example, they might choose the wood tile (gaining 1 wood) and the gold tile (gaining 3 gold).
- Player 1 rolls a 1 and chooses to harvest from their 2x gold tile. They receive 2 gold (the full amount the tile produces).
- Player 1 rolls a 2 and chooses to harvest from their home tile and a 1x ore tile. They receive 1 wood, 1 food, and 1 ore.

### Action: Build & Recruit

- Spend an action die to construct a building or upgrade your castle, or buy more knights or boats.
- A castle is limited to 4 buildings. If you upgrade it, you can add 4 more buildings.
- The die value doesn't matter for building.
- See [Buildings](#buildings) section for costs and benefits.

### Action: Boat Travel

- Spend an action die to move a boat between water zones and transport one knight between coastal tiles.
- A boat can pick up a knight in any adjacent coastal tile, and drop it off in any other adjacent coastal tile.
- A boat can also stay in the same water zone and transport a knight from one coastal tile to another within that zone. That still costs a die.
- When the knight is moved in this way, it is treated in the same way as if the knight moved there on foot. So the knight will be forced to interact with any adventure tokens there, and can claim a resource tile.

**Example**: With a die roll of 3, a boat can move 2 water zones away, pick up a knight, move to an adjacent water zone and deposit them on a coastal tile there.

## Combat

### Fighting Monsters

- When a knight draws a monster card in an adventure tile, they must choose to flee or fight.
- If they flee, they return to their home tile and lose 1 fame (minimum 0).
- If they fight, they roll a D3 and add their might to the score.
  - Knights or warships in adjacent tiles may choose to support the fight (regardless of player). If so, +1 might is added per supporting knight or warship.
  - This decision is made after the dice roll. So a player can offer support, and then choose to betray their support after the dice roll.
  - A knight or warship can support any number of fights in one turn.
- If the attack score is equal to or greater than the monster's might, they defeat the monster and gain the rewards printed on the card.
- If the attack score is less than the monster's might, they lose and are chased back home. They must pay one resource of any type to heal up, or lose 1 fame (minimum 0) if they don't have any resources. Note that trade can happen at any point, so a player may beg another player to contribute resources, or offer to trade for them.
- If a knight loses a fight, the monster card is left in the tile, face up, and any other knight who enters the tile must fight or flee.

**Monster Lairs and Guards:**

- Some tiles have monsters that must be defeated before the tile can be used:
  - **Wolf Den tiles**: These tiles start the game with a wolf monster already placed on them.
  - **Bear Cave tiles**: Located in Tier 2 areas. When revealed through exploration, immediately place a bear monster on the tile.
  - **Resource Tile Guards**: Some resource tiles are guarded by monsters, marked with sword icons. Place the appropriate monster card when the tile is revealed.

### Fighting Other Knights

- A knight can attack another knight by entering the same tile, or in response to another knight attempting to pass through their tile.
- Both players roll 2 D3 dice and add their might to the total score. Knights and warships from adjacent tiles can provide support, similar to when fighting monsters.
- Highest score wins. On even scores, keep rerolling until a winner is found.
- The winner gains 1 Fame and stays in the tile.
- The loser returns to their home tile and must pay one resource of any type to heal. If they have no resources, they lose 1 Fame (minimum 0).
- **Knight Loot**: When defeating a knight, the winner may choose to either:
  - Take one resource of their choice from the defeated player, OR
  - Take one item from the defeated knight's inventory and transfer it to the winning knight's inventory
- If the tile is a resource tile, the winner has the option to spend another die to claim or conquer it after the battle. This is an exception to the rule that a knight only can carry out one action per turn.

### Combat Bonuses

- **Warships**: Upgraded boats (warships) provide +1 Might to any battle in a coastal area adjacent to their ocean zone
- **Support**: Knights in adjacent tiles can support for +1 to roll (negotiate terms)

### Special Combat Rules

- **Dragon**: Has 8 + D3 Might (8 base + D3 roll, determined when revealed). Losing = knight is eaten (removed from game)

---

## Knight Inventory & Items

### Knight Inventory Cards

- Each knight has an inventory card placed on the side of the board closest to the player
- Items purchased from the trader or obtained via other means are placed on these cards
- Each knight can carry at most **2 items** (the inventory card has 2 slots)
- When you recruit additional knights, each gets their own inventory card

### Managing Items

- **Dropping Items**: A knight can drop an item at any time, placing it on the board in their current tile
- **Picking Up Items**: Knights can pick up dropped items by ending their move in a tile containing items. You can use this to transfer items between your own knights.
- **Item Markers**: When items are present in a tile, place the corresponding item marker token in that tile

### Acquiring Items

- **Purchase**: Buy items from the trader using the trader item deck
- **Loot**: Take items from defeated knights in combat

---

## Resources & Trading

- The stockpilable resources are food, wood, ore, and gold.
- Resources are collected by harvesting from resource tiles, or gained from adventure cards.
- Resources are used to upgrade the castle, trade for gold, buy might, and other things.
- Resources can be freely traded with other players at any point. Only the current player can initiate trade with other players.
- Items cannot be directly traded with other players, only indirectly by dropping them in a tile for another player's knight to pick up.

## Conquering another player's tile

- A knight can use an action die to enter another player's tile and conquer it, replacing the flag with one of their own.
- The conquering player can choose to use military might or treachery to conquer the tile. If they use military might, they will pay 1 might (= move down one step on the might track). If they use treachery, they will pay 1 fame instead. They must have positive might or fame to do this.
- If the player who owns the resource tile has a knight in a neighbouring tile, then that knight will passively protect the resource tile from conquest.

## Blockading another player's tile

- A knight that is in another player's resource tile will blockade it. That means the tile temporarily belongs to the blockading player, and they can harvest from it. To stop a blockade, the owning player needs to place a knight in a neighbouring tile, or attack the blockader.
- The blockader must still use a die to harvest from the tile, like when harvesting from their own resource tiles.

### Protection

Knights protect all 4 adjacent tiles from blockade or conquering.

### Trading

Players may freely trade resources at any time
