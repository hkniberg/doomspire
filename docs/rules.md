## How to Play

### Turn Structure

Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn:

1. **Roll Dice**: Roll all your D3 dice (start with 2, gain more with additional champions)
2. **Take Actions**: Use each die to perform one action (dice can be used in any order)
3. **End Turn**: Pass to next player

### Available Actions

Each die can be used for ONE of the following:

- **Move & Act**: Move a champion and perform tile action
- **Harvest**: Collect resources from claimed tiles
- **Build**: Construct a building in your castle
- **Boat Travel**: Move boat and transport a champion

---

## Actions

### Move & Act

**Movement Rules:**

- Move horizontally or vertically (no diagonal movement)
- Movement = die value in tiles
- Cannot end on a tile with another champion (except special locations)
- Can pass through other champions (opponent may choose to initiate combat)
- Multiple dice can be combined for longer movement

**Tile Actions:**

- **Unexplored Tile**: Reveal tile, gain 1 Fame, resolve explore cards if any
- **Resource Tile**: Claim with flag (if unclaimed) OR challenge existing claim
- **Special Location**: Use location ability
- **Monster Tile**: Fight the monster

### Harvest Resources

- Use die to collect resources from tiles you've claimed
- Die value = total resources you can collect
- Can collect from multiple tiles
- Can only harvest from tiles showing your flag

**Example**: Roll a 2, own a x1 Food tile and a x1 Gold tile = collect 1 Food + 1 Gold

### Build

- Spend resources to construct buildings in your castle
- Die value doesn't matter for building
- See [Buildings](#buildings) section for costs and benefits

### Boat Travel

- Move boat between water zones (4 zones around island)
- Transport one champion from any coastal tile in starting zone to any coastal tile in destination zone
- Die value determines movement: 1 = adjacent water zone only, 2-3 = any water zone
