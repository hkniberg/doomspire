# Lords of Doomspire - Development Plan

## Current Implementation Status (before Milestone 1)

### What We Have Built

**Foundation**: The project has a solid foundation with comprehensive TypeScript types, game state modeling, and visual representation. The core data structures accurately represent the board game mechanics including tiles, players, champions, boats, and resources.

**UI Layer**: A complete Next.js-based interface that visualizes the game board, player information, and game state. Includes debug modes, interactive controls, and modern responsive design.

**AI Integration**: Working LLM integration using Anthropic's Claude API with tool calling capabilities. The AI can analyze game state and suggest actions through defined tools (moveChampion, moveBoat, harvest).

**Game Board Generation**: Deterministic random map generator that creates realistic game boards following the established tier-based rules.

**Template System**: Dynamic prompt generation that injects game rules and current state into AI conversations.

### What's Missing

**Game Engine**: No actual game logic execution - actions are suggested but don't modify game state. Missing rule validation, action processing, and turn management.

**Player System**: No formal player abstractions or automated player implementations. Current system only supports manual AI interaction.

**Game Flow**: No structured turn sequence, victory condition checking, or complete game lifecycle management.

**Headless Execution**: No CLI-based simulation capability for automated testing and analysis.

### Assessment

**Progress**: Excellent foundation and UI, but missing the core simulation engine.

**Current State**: More of a "game viewer with AI commentary" than a functional game simulation.

## Development Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Single Turn Execution (Headless, Random Player) ✅ **COMPLETED**

Implement core game engine architecture, with the ability to execute one player turn using a random decision-making player in headless mode. This validates that the fundamental game simulation mechanics work correctly. As part of this we create the new interfaces and new directory structure, and start migrating the existing code to the new structure.

### Milestone 2: Full Game Execution (Headless, Random Players) ✅ **COMPLETED**

Extend the engine to support complete games from start to finish with multiple random players. Includes victory condition checking and proper game lifecycle management.

### Milestone 3: Single Turn Execution (UI, Random Player) ✅ **COMPLETED**

Integrate the new game engine with the existing user interface, allowing players to execute actual turns through the web interface rather than just viewing static game state.

### Milestone 4: Single Turn Execution (Headless, Claude AI)

Replace random decision-making with AI-powered strategic play using the existing Claude integration. This proves that AI players can successfully interface with the game engine.

### Milestone 5: Single Turn Execution (UI, Claude AI)

Final integration that combines the working game engine with AI players in the user interface. This milestone will closely resemble the current application but with functional gameplay underneath.

## Strategic Approach

Each milestone builds incrementally on the previous one, changing only one major component at a time. This approach isolates potential issues and ensures steady progress toward the target architecture while maintaining the valuable work already completed.

The sequence prioritizes proving the core simulation works before adding complexity, ensuring we have a solid foundation for future enhancements like batch analysis, advanced AI players, and comprehensive logging systems.
