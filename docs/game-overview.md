# Lords of Doomspire - Game Overview

Lords of Doomspire is a strategic board game where 4 players command knights to explore a dangerous island, gather resources, and ultimately face a great dragon.

**Players:** 4 | **Time:** 90-120 minutes

## How to Play

Send knights from your castle to explore an 8x8 island divided into three tiers - outer areas are safer, but the center holds greater dangers and rewards. The mighty dragon rules from Doomspire at the heart of the island.

Each turn: roll dice, move knights to explore tiles, fight monsters, claim territories, harvest resources, and build improvements. Trade freely with other players and choose your path to victory.

## Victory Conditions

Reach Doomspire and achieve any of:

- **Combat Victory**: Defeat the dragon in battle
- **Diplomatic Victory**: Arrive with 12+ Fame
- **Economic Victory**: Control 4+ starred resource tiles
- **Gold Victory**: Arrive with 20+ Gold

## What Makes It Special

Multiple victory paths encourage different strategies while interactive combat and resource trading create rich player interaction. The tiered island design creates meaningful risk-versus-reward decisions as you venture toward the dragon's lair.
