# Lords of Doomspire - Game Overview

## What is Lords of Doomspire?

Lords of Doomspire is a strategic board game where 4 players command champions to explore a dangerous island, gather resources, and ultimately face a great dragon. Players start from their island castles and venture forth seeking fame, fortune, and glory.

**Players:** 4

## Core Concept

You are a lord sending champions from your castle to explore a mysterious neighboring island. The island is divided into three tiers of increasing danger and reward, with the mighty dragon ruling from Doomspire at the center. Balance risk and reward as you claim territory, fight monsters, gather resources, and build your power.

## Key Components

- **8x8 exploration board** with 3 tiers of tiles (outer = safer, center = dangerous)
- **Champions** - your brave explorers (start with 1, can recruit up to 3)

- **Resources** - Food, Wood, Ore, and Gold for building and trading
- **Adventure cards** - Monsters to fight, treasures to find, events to navigate
