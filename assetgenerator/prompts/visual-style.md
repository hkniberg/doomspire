Use a hand-drawn cartoon style, suitable for a fantasyboard game card or tile. The style should be playful, colorful, and whimsical, resembling children's storybook art. Use:

- Flat, vibrant colors with little or no shading
- Thick black outlines around objects
- Simple geometric shapes and wobbly linework
- Textured fill made from scribbly strokes or hatching for foliage, roofing, and similar surfaces
- Fantasy RPG context

The image should look like artwork appropriate for a board game card or tile, with a top-down or slight isometric view when applicable.

Do not include any text, borders, or realistic rendering â€” keep everything stylized and consistent with a hand-drawn look. Generate only the image itself, no card borders or other structural elements.
