The visual style should be a distinct and cohesive blend of **fantasy illustration** and **storybook art**, characterized by the following key elements:

---

### **1. Artistic Medium & Technique**

- **Digital painting** that mimics **traditional gouache or watercolor** textures, with visible brush strokes and soft blending.
- Uses **rich, saturated colors** and **soft lighting**, giving the scenes a warm and slightly whimsical tone.

---

### **2. Character Design**

- Creatures (e.g., treant, goblins, wolf, boar) are **stylized yet expressive**, with exaggerated features like:

  - Glowing eyes (especially the treant and goblins),
  - Sharp claws or teeth for intimidation,
  - Angry or menacing facial expressions.

---

### **3. Environment**

- Backgrounds feature **lush forests**, **dirt paths**, and **mushrooms**, evoking a **fairy tale woodland** setting.
- Landscapes use **rounded, organic shapes** with **simple, clean compositions**, emphasizing readability and charm over realism.

---

### **4. Color Palette**

- Dominated by **earth tones** (browns, greens, and muted reds) with **strategic pops of bright color** (like glowing eyes or red mushrooms).
- Balanced contrasts help foreground characters stand out without clashing with the soft, idyllic backgrounds.

---

### **5. Mood & Atmosphere**

- Slightly **adventurous**, suitable for fantasy board games, or light RPGs.

---

### **6. Inspirations**

This style is reminiscent of:

- **Classic fantasy book illustrations** (e.g., Brian Froud, Tony DiTerlizzi),
- **Board games or mobile RPGs** with a fantasy setting,
- Modern **storybook art** that blends fantasy creatures with accessible visuals.

The image should look like artwork appropriate for a board game card or tile, with a top-down or slight isometric view when applicable.

Do not include any text, borders, or realistic rendering — keep everything stylized and consistent with a hand-drawn look. Generate only the image itself, no card borders or other structural elements.
