Create a board game tile illustration in a hand-drawn cartoon style. The scene should feature:
[insert main subject: e.g., a wheat field with tall golden stalks, a small wooden tavern, a forest path, a gold mine, a market stall, etc.]
The style should be playful, colorful, and whimsical, resembling children's storybook art. Use:

- Flat, vibrant colors with little or no shading
- Thick black outlines around objects
- Simple geometric shapes and wobbly linework
- A light blue sky in the background with minimal clouds or scribbles
- Considering adding a curving dirt path (yellow or tan) leading into or through the scene (optional, but common)
- Textured fill made from scribbly strokes or hatching for foliage or roofing

The scene should look like a board game tile or artwork in a board game card, top-down or slight isometric view
Do not include any text, borders, or realistic rendering â€” keep everything stylized and consistent with a hand-drawn look.
